# Brain_Tumor_Detection-main
Brain Tumor Detection is a Machine Learnig Tumor detection Model based on the concept of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The model uses CNN to analyze brain MRI scans and predict if the scan has a tumor in it ot not.
The model;s UI has been developed on StreamLit where the user can upload MRI scans of the brain to see the results. 
The total accuracy that the model holds is around 80%.
